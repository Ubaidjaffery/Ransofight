# Ransofight
Prevention against Ransomware attack, an automated implementation which help to prevent ransomware attacks


After doing a comprehensive research I along with my team members prepared an Anti Dot which is the life saving Anti Dot for Ransomware and the major part it does not cost a lot, by assessing environment and organizational scale the Anti Dot for the Ransomware is cost effective. 
Note: One thing that we should keep in our mind is that the anatomy of all Ransomware lies upon triggering the file extension which is of .PDF, .TXT, .DOCX, .ZIP etc.

We will not be building any solution, Hardware Box or device which prevent Ransomware attack.
